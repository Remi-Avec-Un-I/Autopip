# Autopip
It download all the python lib of all the python script in a folder, automatically.
All you have to do is to put this script in the same folder as the python script that you want to download libs, and to run this script.
It works by trying to download everythings that can be a lib in the script (a lot of lib that will be tried to download won't work, because they don't exist), so it can download useless lib, and (rarely ever) not work.
